PART_A_EXPLANATION = """
On the clean baseline dataset, formatting did not change correctness. All
three prompt styles returned valid venues, but the chosen answer varied:
plain selected Haymarket Vaults, while XML and sandwich selected Albanach.
That suggests both options were salient and structure only nudged which valid
candidate the model preferred.

The Holyrood Arms looked like the hardest distractor because it matched the
capacity threshold exactly and still had vegan options. The only failing field
was status=full, which is easier for a model to miss than the clearer
vegan=no mismatch on New Town Vault.

# Explain what Part C showed, or why it wasn't needed. Minimum 30 words.
PART_C_EXPLANATION = """
Part C ran because Parts A and B were all correct on the 70B model. Even
after switching to Gemma 2 2B and keeping the distractors, all three
conditions still produced correct answers. For this dataset, the signal stayed
strong enough that smaller-model weakness still did not create a visible
formatting failure.

# Complete this sentence. Minimum 40 words.
# "Context formatting matters most when..."

CORE_LESSON = """
Context formatting matters most when the task is noisy, the relevant facts are
buried among near-misses, or the model is weak enough that it needs explicit
structure to keep the constraints salient. When the context is short and the
signal is clean, plain formatting can still work just as well.
