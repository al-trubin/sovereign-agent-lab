# ── Task A ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# List of tool names called during Task A, in order of first appearance.
# Look at [TOOL_CALL] lines in your terminal output.
# Example: ["check_pub_availability", "get_edinburgh_weather"]

TASK_A_TOOLS_CALLED = [
    "check_pub_availability",
    "calculate_catering_cost",
    "get_edinburgh_weather",
    "generate_event_flyer",
]

# Which venue did the agent confirm? Must be one of:
# "The Albanach", "The Haymarket Vaults", or "none"
TASK_A_CONFIRMED_VENUE = "The Albanach"

# Total catering cost the agent calculated. Float, e.g. 5600.0
# Write 0.0 if the agent didn't calculate it.
TASK_A_CATERING_COST_GBP = 5600.0

# Did the weather tool return outdoor_ok = True or False?
TASK_A_OUTDOOR_OK = True

# Optional — anything unexpected.
# If you used a non-default model via RESEARCH_MODEL env var, note it here.
# Example: "Used nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b for the agent loop."
TASK_A_NOTES = (
    "Used the default Qwen/Qwen3-32B model. The surprising part of Task A was "
    "that the agent confirmed The Albanach immediately and never checked The "
    "Haymarket Vaults, even though the brief explicitly named both venues."
)

# ── Task B ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The scaffold ships with a working generate_event_flyer that has two paths:
#
#   - Live mode: if FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL is set in .env, the tool calls that
#     model and returns a real image URL.
#   - Placeholder mode: otherwise (the default) the tool returns a
#     deterministic placehold.co URL with mode="placeholder".
#
# Both paths return success=True. Both count as "implemented" for grading.
# This is not the original Task B — the original asked you to write a direct
# FLUX image call, but Nebius removed FLUX on 2026-04-13. See CHANGELOG.md
# §Changed for why we pivoted the task.

# Did your run of the flyer tool produce a success=True result?
# (This will be True for both live and placeholder mode — both are valid.)
TASK_B_IMPLEMENTED = True

# Which path did your run take? "live" or "placeholder"
# Look for the "mode" field in the TOOL_RESULT output of Task B.
# If you didn't set FLYER_IMAGE_MODEL in .env, you will get "placeholder".
TASK_B_MODE = "placeholder"

# The image URL returned by the tool. Copy exactly from your terminal output.
# In placeholder mode this will be a placehold.co URL.
# In live mode it will be a provider CDN URL.
TASK_B_IMAGE_URL = "https://placehold.co/1200x628/1a1a2e/eaeaea?text=The+Haymarket+Vaults+%7C+160+guests&id=2ef939fbbaf6"

# The prompt sent to the image model. Copy from terminal output.
TASK_B_PROMPT_USED = "Professional event flyer for Edinburgh AI Meetup, tech professionals, modern venue at The Haymarket Vaults, Edinburgh. 160 guests tonight. Warm lighting, Scottish architecture background, clean modern typography."

# Why did the agent's behaviour NOT change when Nebius removed FLUX?
# One sentence. This is the point of the lesson.
TASK_B_WHY_AGENT_SURVIVED = """
The agent survived because the tool contract stayed stable: even without a
live image provider, generate_event_flyer still returned success=True, a
prompt_used value, and a usable image_url via the placeholder fallback.
"""

# ── Task C ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Scenario 1: first choice unavailable
# Quote the specific message where the agent changed course. Min 20 words.
SCENARIO_1_PIVOT_MOMENT = """
After the tool returned that The Bow Bar had "status": "full" and
"meets_all_constraints": false, the very next step was another tool call to
check_pub_availability for The Albanach. That immediate second tool call was
the pivot from failed first choice to fallback venue.
"""

SCENARIO_1_FALLBACK_VENUE = "The Albanach"

# Scenario 2: impossible constraint (300 guests)
# Did the agent recommend a pub name not in the known venues list?
SCENARIO_2_HALLUCINATED = False

# Paste the final [AI] message.
SCENARIO_2_FINAL_ANSWER = """
None of the known Edinburgh venues can accommodate 300 guests with vegan
options. The maximum capacity among the listed pubs is 200 at The Guilford
Arms (which lacks vegan options), while venues with vegan options
(Albanach, Haymarket Vaults, Bow Bar) have capacities of 180, 160, and 80
respectively. You'll need to consider alternative venues or adjust your
requirements.
"""

# Scenario 3: out of scope (train times)
# Did the agent try to call a tool?
SCENARIO_3_TRIED_A_TOOL = False

SCENARIO_3_RESPONSE = "I don't have access to real-time train schedules or transportation data. For the most accurate information about the last train from Edinburgh Waverley to London, I recommend checking National Rail, Citymapper, Trainline, or the relevant train operator."

# Would this behaviour be acceptable in a real booking assistant? Min 30 words.
SCENARIO_3_ACCEPTABLE = """
This was acceptable as a safe fallback because the agent did not hallucinate
train times or misuse an unrelated tool. In a real booking assistant I would
still want a better handoff path, such as transferring to a transport tool
or explicitly escalating to a human.

TASK_D_COMPARISON = """
The LangGraph Mermaid graph is extremely compact: one agent node loops over
one tools node until it decides to stop. By contrast, Rasa CALM's
flows.yml writes the dialogue path explicitly with ordered collect steps and
named actions, so the routing is visible up front instead of emerging at
runtime.

# ── Reflection ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# The most unexpected thing the agent did. Min 40 words.
# Must reference a specific behaviour from your run.

MOST_SURPRISING = """
The most unexpected behavior was in Task A: the brief explicitly said to
check both The Albanach and The Haymarket Vaults, but the agent checked only
The Albanach, saw that it satisfied the constraints, and immediately moved
on to catering, weather, and flyer generation. It optimized for "good
enough" completion rather than strict obedience to every sub-instruction.
